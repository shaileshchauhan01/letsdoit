<h1>Basic HTML Animals</h1>

<p>This is the <em>first paragraph</em> in our page. It <em>introduces our animals</em>. </p>

<h2>The Llama</h2>

<p>Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When she spies a patch of them on a web page, she will eat them like sweets, licking her lips as she goes. </p>

<h2>The Anaconda</h2>

<p>The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page, travelling rapidly by way of anchors to sneak up on his prey. <p>
